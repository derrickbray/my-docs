    <div class="container">
      <h2 class="step">This will show you how to bundle different modules together and have a large and complete js file to load on a script tag or wherever you deploy.  For this exercise we will make a page that uses two different JS files along with some SCSS.  We will also bundle jQuery and some other tools using npm.
      </h2>

      <h3 class="step">1. Lets start a new project.</h3>
      <div class="instructions">In your terminal type</div>
      <div class="command">$mkdir webpack-demo</div>
      <div class="instructions">Make sure you get into your new folder.</div>
      <div class="command">$cd webpack-demo</div>

      <h3 class="step">2. Now lets create a package.json file.</h3>
      <div class="instructions">In your terminal type</div>
      <div class="command">npm init</div>
      <div class="instructions">This should prompt you to answer a few questions. You should be able to just hit enter for all. If you want to fill out the discription you can or you can do it later. The one important thing is the entry file name, by default it should be index.js. That is fine but you can change that too if you want. Finally it will show you the JSON and ask if it is okay, just hit enter.
