    <h1 class="title">Bundle a project using Webpack</h1>

    <div class="container">
      <h2 class="step">This will show you how to bundle different modules together and have a large and complete js file to load on a script tag or wherever you deploy.  For this exercise we will make a page that uses two different JS files along with some SCSS.  We will also bundle jQuery and some other tools using npm.
      </h2>

      <h3 class="step">1. Make sure you're ready</h3>
      <div class="instructions">Check and see if you have a current version of node. If you do you should also have npm installed.
      </div>

      <h3 class="step">2. Lets start a new project.</h3>
      <div class="instructions">In your terminal type</div>
      <div class="command">$ mkdir webpack-demo</div>
      <div class="instructions">Make sure you get into your new folder.</div>
      <div class="command">$ cd webpack-demo</div>

      <h3 class="step">3. Now lets create a package.json file.</h3>
      <div class="instructions">In your terminal type</div>
      <div class="command">$ npm init</div>
      <div class="instructions">This should prompt you to answer a few questions. You should be able to just hit enter for all. If you want to fill out the discription you can or you can do it later. The one important thing is the entry file name, by default it should be index.js (that is what we will use here). That is fine but you can change that too if you want. Finally, it will show you the JSON and ask if it is okay, just hit enter.
      </div>

      <h3 class="step">4. Install and prepare project for Webpack</h3>
      <div class="instructions">We will install this locally, but you can do globally.</div>
      <div class="command">$ npm install --save-dev webpack</div>
      <div class="instructions">Now we will need to create some folders and files.</div>
      <div class="instructions">So inside your project folder we need a dist folder, this is where your bundled file will come out at. You don't need to do anything else here.</div>
      <div class="command">$ mkdir dist</div>
      <div class="instructions">Also inside your project folder you need a src folder (or source folder). This is where we will put our modules that go into our bundle.</div>
      <div class="command">$ mkdir src</div>
      <div class="instructions">Let's make our index.js file inside of the src folder. This will be the main entry file for our bundle.
      </div>
      <div class="instructions">From the terminal in your project enter</div>
      <div class="command">$ touch src/index.js</div>
      <div class="instructions">While here lets go ahead and make some more files: name.js webpack.config.js and index.html</div>
      <div class="command">$ touch src/name.js</div>
      <div class="command">$ touch webpack.config.js</div>
      <div class="command">$ touch index.html</div>
      <div class="instructions"><div class="red">Note that only the name.js and index.js are in the src folder, the others are not.</div></div>

      <h3 class="step">5. Setup your HTML file.</h3>
      <div class="instructions">Go to the index.html file.</div>
      <div class="command">Type "html" to get your boilerplate.</div>
      <div class="instructions">Then add a script tag to the body. <div class="red">You will need to add the opening brackets!</div></div>
      <div class="command">script src="dist/index.js">/script></div>
      <div class="instructions">Now when you load your html page the script will find the bundle.</div>

      <h3 class="step">6. Setup your webpack.config file.</h3>
      <div class="instructions">Go to your webpack.config.js file and add</div>
      <div class="command">
        var path = require('path');<br>
        module.exports = {<br>
        entry: './src/index.js',<br>
        output: {<br>
        filemane: 'bundle.js',<br>
        path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist')<br>
        }<br>
        };</div>
